In Python, method overloading is a feature that allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Unlike some other programming languages like Java or C++, where method overloading is supported through function signatures that differ in the number or types of their parameters, Python method overloading is achieved through default arguments and variable-length argument lists such as `*args` and `**kwargs`.

Method overloading in Python is not enforced by the language itself but is a convention followed by programmers to create more flexible and readable code. When you call a method with different argument lists, Python will choose the appropriate implementation based on the number and types of arguments provided.

Here's a simple example of method overloading in Python:

```python

"""


class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def add(self, a, b, c):
        return a + b + c


# Create an object of the Calculator class
my_calculator = Calculator()

# Call the overloaded add method
result1 = my_calculator.add(5, 3)
result2 = my_calculator.add(5, 3, 2)

print("Result with two arguments:", result1)
print("Result with three arguments:", result2)

"""
```

In this example, we have a `Calculator` class with two `add` methods. The first `add` method takes two arguments, and the second `add` method takes three arguments. When you call these methods, Python will select the appropriate implementation based on the number of arguments provided.

However, it's important to note that the latest method definition in a class will override any previous definitions with the same name. In the example above, the second `add` method effectively overloads the first one.

While Python supports method overloading in this manner, it's not as common as in some other languages, and it's often considered more readable and conventional to use default arguments and variable-length argument lists (as mentioned in the previous response) for achieving similar flexibility when dealing with different argument lists.
